                <p>Here are the live results from the psychographic microsurvey that offered in tandem with the full <a href="../furrysurvey">Furry Survey</a>.  The answers to the questions from this survey were used to conduct additional research into some potential shared psychological traits of the members of the furry fandom.  Questions were provided as statements and answered on a six-level scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"  Below, you can see the general outcome of the results and explore correlations between the answers to those questions.</p>
