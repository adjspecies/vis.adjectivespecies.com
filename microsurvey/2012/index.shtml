                <p>This visualization shows responses to the 2012 Microsurvey, allowing one to correlate answers.  The psychographic microsurvey was offered alongside the regular 2011 furry survey (it was incorporated in the main survey this year), and was used to conduct additional research into some potential shared psychological traits of members of the furry fandom.  Questions were provided as statements and answered on a six-level scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree".  Below, you can see the outcome of the results and explore correlations between the answers to those questions.</p>
                <p>Hover over the bars to see the full question text.  Click on segments of the bars to filter responses.</p>
